## 🎯 Project Overview

This project focuses on **Manual Testing** of an **Online Book Store** web application, carried out as part of the **Summer Internship 2025** at **ABESIT**.  
The primary objective was to ensure software quality by identifying defects and verifying functionality through structured manual testing.  
The process followed the **Agile Scrum methodology** and utilized **JIRA** for bug tracking, sprint management, and reporting.

⚡ **Note:** The Online Book Store web application code was sourced from a public GitHub repository (MERN-based project).
All **manual testing activities**, documentation, reports, and analysis included here were **performed entirely by me** during the internship.

## 🧪 Testing Process

### 📝 1. Test Planning
- Defined **testing objectives**, roles, and responsibilities.  
- Identified **features to be tested** and **not to be tested**.  
- Developed a **test schedule**, entry/exit criteria, and risk assessment plan.

### 🧠 2. Test Design
- Created detailed **test cases and test scenarios** in Excel.  
- Prepared **Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)** to ensure requirement coverage.  
- Developed **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)** and **Decision Tables** for system understanding.

### ⚙️ 3. Test Execution
- Executed test cases manually and recorded **actual vs. expected results**.  
- Captured **screenshots** for both passed and failed test scenarios.  
- Verified fixes and conducted regression testing after bug resolution.

### 🐞 4. Defect Tracking (via JIRA)
- Logged and categorized **defects by severity and priority**.  
- Managed **User Stories, Sprint Backlogs**, and **Task Assignments** on Scrum boards.  
- Monitored sprint progress using **Burndown Charts** and **JIRA Reports**.

### 📊 5. Reporting & Review
- Documented outcomes in the **final project report** and **presentation**.  
- Analyzed test results and provided **improvement recommendations** for better software quality.
